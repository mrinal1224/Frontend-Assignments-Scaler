<!-- Assignment: CSS Variables

Problem Description:

You are given a web page with several elements that need to be styled using CSS. Your task is to use CSS variables to store and reuse values throughout the CSS file.

Hints:

CSS variables are declared using the -- syntax.
CSS variables can be used in any property value in the CSS file.
CSS variables can be updated dynamically using JavaScript.


Solution Approach:

Start by creating a CSS file and linking it to your HTML file using the <link> tag.
In the CSS file, declare your CSS variables at the top of the file using the -- syntax.
Use the CSS variables throughout the file to specify values for different properties.
Test your solution by previewing the web page in a browser and verifying that the elements have been styled correctly. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is some sample text that needs to be formatted.</p>
    <div class="box">
      <p>This is a box with a specified height and width.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Test Cases:
