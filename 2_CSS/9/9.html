<!-- Assignment: CSS Units

Problem Description:

You are given a web page with several elements that need to be styled using CSS. Your task is to style these elements using different units of measurement in CSS.

Hints:

CSS supports various units of measurement, including pixels (px), ems (em), rems (rem), percent (%), and viewport units (vh, vw, vmin, vmax).
The size of an element in pixels is fixed, whereas the size of an element in ems or rems is relative to the font size of the parent element.
Percent is used to specify the size of an element in relation to its parent element.
Viewport units are used to specify the size of an element in relation to the size of the viewport.


Solution Approach:

Start by creating a CSS file and linking it to your HTML file using the <link> tag.
In the CSS file, create selectors for the elements you want to style.
Use the various units of measurement to specify the size of the elements.
Test your solution by previewing the web page in a browser and verifying that the elements have been styled correctly. -->


<!-- Test Cases:

Verify that the text in the <h1> element is 36 pixels in size.
Verify that the text in the first <p> element has a font size of 1.5 times the size of the parent element's font size.
Verify that the height of the <div> element is 50% of the viewport height.
Verify that the width of the <div> element is 80% of the width of its parent element. -->
