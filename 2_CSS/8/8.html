<!-- Assignment: CSS Text Formatting

Problem Description:

You have been given a web page which contains plain text. Your task is to format the text on the web page using CSS.

Hints:

Use CSS properties such as font-size, font-family, color, text-align, text-decoration, and line-height to format the text.
You can also use classes and id selectors to apply styles to specific elements on the web page.
Solution Approach:

Start by creating a CSS file and linking it to your HTML file using the <link> tag.
In the CSS file, create selectors for the elements you want to style.
Use the CSS properties listed in the hints section to format the text.
Test your solution by previewing the web page in a browser. -->
