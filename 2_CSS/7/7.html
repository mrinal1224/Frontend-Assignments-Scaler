<!-- Assignment Problem: CSS Media Queries

Problem Description:
The goal of this problem is to use CSS media queries to create a responsive layout for a webpage that adjusts based on the screen size.

Hints:

Use @media rule to define media queries.
Use max-width and min-width to set breakpoints for the layout to change.
Use CSS selectors and properties to change the styles based on the screen size.


Solution Approach:

Decide on the layout that needs to be created for different screen sizes.
Identify the breakpoints for the layout to change.
Write the CSS code to define the media queries and set the styles for each screen size. -->

<!-- Test Cases:

Verify that @media rule is used to define media queries.
Verify that max-width and min-width are used to set breakpoints for the layout to change.
Verify that CSS selectors and properties are used to change the styles based on the screen size.
Verify that the layout changes as expected when the screen size is smaller than the breakpoint defined in the media query. -->
