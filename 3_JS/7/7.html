<!-- Problem: Highlight Text on Mouse Over

Description:
Given a HTML page with a paragraph of text, write JavaScript code that changes the background color of the text to yellow when the mouse pointer is over it and changes it back to white when the mouse pointer is not over it.

Hints:

Use the addEventListener method to listen for "mouseover" and "mouseout" events on the paragraph element.
Use the style property to change the background color of the text.
Solution Approach:

Get the paragraph element using the document.getElementById method.
Use the addEventListener method to listen for "mouseover" and "mouseout" events on the paragraph element.
In the "mouseover" event listener function, use the style property to change the background color of the text to yellow.
In the "mouseout" event listener function, use the style property to change the background color of the text back to white. -->
