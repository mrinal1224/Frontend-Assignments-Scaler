<!-- Problem Description:

You are required to create a simple web page with several buttons and write JavaScript code to handle the click events of each button. When a button is clicked, a different action should be performed depending on which button was clicked.

for ex -
if button 1 is clicked the output on the screen should 'button 1 is clicked'
if button 2 is clicked the output on the screen should 'button 2 is clicked'

Hints and Solution Approach:

First, create the HTML for the web page, including several buttons.

Next, write JavaScript code to handle the click events of each button. This can be done using the addEventListener method, which allows you to attach an event handler function to an element.

In the event handler function, use a conditional statement to determine which button was clicked and perform the appropriate action. For example, you could change the text of a <p> element, show or hide an element, or perform some other action.

Test your code thoroughly to ensure that the correct action is performed when each button is clicked. -->


<html>
  <head>
 
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
    <button id="button3">Button 3</button>
    <p id="output"></p>
  </body>
  <script src="3.js"></script>
</html>
