<!-- Problem Description:
Create a basic to-do list application that allows users to add and remove tasks from a list. -->

<!-- Hints:

Use JavaScript to handle the logic for adding and removing tasks from the list.
Use CSS to style the to-do list and task inputs(optional)
Use HTML to create the structure of the to-do list and task inputs. -->

<!-- Solution Approach:

Create a container div to hold the to-do list and task input.
Create an unordered list to display the tasks.
Create an input field and a "Add" button to allow users to input and add tasks.
Use JavaScript to handle the click event on the "Add" button and add the task to the list.
Add a "Remove" button to each task in the list and use JavaScript to handle the click event and remove the task.
 -->

<!-- Test Cases:

Verify that a task can be added to the to-do list.
Verify that a task can be removed from the to-do list.
Verify that the input field is cleared after a task is added to the list.
Verify that an error message is displayed when the user tries to add an empty task. -->
