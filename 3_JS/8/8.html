<!-- Problem: Print Key Presses on the Screen

Description:
Given a HTML page with an input field, write JavaScript code that displays the character of each key press in real-time in a div element on the page.

Hints:

Use the addEventListener method to listen for a "keypress" event on the input field.
Use the key property of the event object to get the character of each key press.
Use the innerHTML property to update the div element with the characters.


Solution Approach:

Get the input field and the div element using the document.getElementById method.
Use the addEventListener method to listen for a "keypress" event on the input field.
In the event listener function, use the key property of the event object to get the character of each key press.
Use the innerHTML property to update the div element with the characters. -->


<!-- Test Cases:

Type characters into the input field, the characters should be displayed in real-time in the div element.
Delete characters from the input field, the characters should be removed from the div element. -->
